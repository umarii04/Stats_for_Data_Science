## 1. 1_central_tendency.ipynb
**Topic:** Measures of Central Tendency (Mean, Median, Mode)

- **Summary:**
  - Explains and demonstrates how to calculate mean, median, and mode for numerical and categorical data.
  - Uses pandas, numpy, and seaborn for data analysis.
  - Includes code for geometric and harmonic means, and standard error.
- **Key Code:**
  - Calculation of mean, median, mode using pandas/numpy.
  - Example: `df["age"].mean()`, `df["age"].median()`, `df["class"].mode()`
- **Result:**
  - Shows how to interpret and compute central tendency for real datasets.

## 2. 2_data_distributions.ipynb
**Topic:** Data Distributions

- **Summary:**
  - Covers types of data distributions (normal, skewed, etc.).
  - Visualizes distributions using histograms and boxplots.
- **Key Code:**
  - Plotting with matplotlib/seaborn.
- **Result:**
  - Visual understanding of data spread and shape.

## 3. 3_skewness_and_kurtosis.ipynb
**Topic:** Skewness and Kurtosis

- **Summary:**
  - Explains skewness (asymmetry) and kurtosis (tailedness) of distributions.
  - Shows how to compute and interpret these statistics.
- **Key Code:**
  - `scipy.stats.skew()`, `scipy.stats.kurtosis()`
- **Result:**
  - Helps in understanding data normality and outliers.

## 4. 4_chi_square_test.ipynb
**Topic:** Chi-Square Test

- **Summary:**
  - Demonstrates chi-square test for independence using contingency tables.
  - Example with Titanic dataset: association between sex and survival.
- **Key Code:**
  - `pd.crosstab()`, `scipy.stats.chi2_contingency()`
- **Result:**
  - Shows how to interpret p-values and test hypotheses for categorical data.

---

## 5. 5_shapiro_wilk_normalization_test.ipynb
**Topic:** Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test

- **Summary:**
  - Tests if data is normally distributed.
- **Key Code:**
  - `scipy.stats.shapiro()`
- **Result:**
  - Guides on when to use parametric vs non-parametric tests.

## 12_Chi_squared_case_study.ipynb
**Topic:** Chi-Squared Test Case Study

- **Summary:**
  - Applies chi-squared test to real datasets (e.g., tips dataset from seaborn).
  - Compares observed vs expected frequencies for categorical variables (e.g., vegetarian vs non-vegetarian, sex vs smoker, sex vs time).
- **Key Code:**
  - `chisquare(observed, expected)`
  - `chi2_contingency(pd.crosstab(df['sex'], df['smoker']))`
- **Result:**
  - Interprets p-values to accept/reject null hypothesis about association between variables.
